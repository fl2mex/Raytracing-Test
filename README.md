# Raytracing-Test
Following "Raytracing In One Weekend" and subsequent books to learn about raytracing. <br>
These books are found at: https://raytracing.github.io/

# Building
You can build on windows, no strings attached. <br>
Everything should be set up as it is (If there's a problem please create an issue haha) <br>
just go ahead and build :^) <br>

# Outputting a file
To output a file, you will need to build the file, <br>
Then open command prompt to path to the file, <br>
Then run: `.\"Raytracing Test.exe > image.ppm"` <br>
Then open the ppm file, my preferred website is [this one.](https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html)

# Output:
